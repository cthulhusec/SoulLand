This is a small 2D, turn based, dungeon strategy game developed for the Bussiness Proffesionals of America Software Engineering Team Competition in for the 2016-17 season. 

**Features:**  
* Turnbased movement and combat  
* Inventory System  
* Ability Items  
* AI Movement  

### Project Summary
For this competion we were tasked with making an original Role Playing Game. We decided to go the route of a rougelike game meaning that we were focusing on a simple, dungeon based combat system with permadeath and some sort of items to be collected. 

We were working under time constraints and during the school year and did not fufil our original design goals. We had planned on implementing a more in-depth combat system, more items, textured graphics and sprites, and procedural level generation but had to scale down in order to meet our deadlines. We are happy with our product that we created as 2 members of the team had limited programming experience and had  never worked on a game before in any capacity.   

Though we wish we could have done more we have enjoyed showcasing and playing our game. We all learned a lot from the project; some learned how game development works, some learned C#, some strengthened their existings skills. We value our time  spent on this project and the oppurtunity to compete very highly.

**Our team won 7th place at the National Leadership Conference in May 2017.**
